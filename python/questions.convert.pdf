1. Which language was easier Python or Impcore? Why?

Python was easier; mostly because it has been my goto language for many things. I've done web services, scripts, low
level, and even entire GUI apps with Python. So naturally being able to write code down for Python was easier.

Additionally, a lot of the logic was already done with improce, and transposing 
it to python was essentially reading the semantics of impcore, which are quite straight forward.

It is important to note that the mentality when programming these problems are way different; Python and
Impcore are just different ways to put it in code and its worthy to mention that Impcores is nothing but a
syntax hurdle to write the program down. 


2. Did not having the built-in libraries make it harder?

Not really, because the approach was assuming no libraries from IMPCORE since the 
beggining, so it made no difference.


3. Which gave a more accurate answer? Why?

Impcore suprisingly gave a more accurate answer, and that had to do mostly because of the recurison
limit that could be more easily exceeded by python (even after setting it to the max on my OS).
