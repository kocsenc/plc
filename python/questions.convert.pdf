1. Which language was easier Python or Impcore? Why?

Python was easier; mostly because it has been my goto language for many things. I've done web services, scripts, low
level, and even entire GUI apps with Python. So naturally being able to write code down for Python was easier.

It is important to note that the mentality when programming these problems are way different; Python and
Impcore are just different ways to put it in code and its worthy to mention that Impcores is nothing but a
syntax hurdle to write the program down. 

2. Did not having the built-in libraries make it harder?

Yes it did make it harder; which is why the playing field was a little bit more level between Python and Impcore.
This made it so that the way to approach the problems was the same.
